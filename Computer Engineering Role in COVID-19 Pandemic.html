AI tools can help in many different ways. They are being used to predict the spread of the coronavirus, map its genetic evolution as
it transmits from human to human, speed up diagnosis, and in the development of potential treatments, while also helping policymakers
cope with related issues, such as the impact on transport, food supplies and traveL.The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes the current
outbreak of the respiratory disease COVID-19. Researchers worldwide are focusing their efforts on investigating this virus and
finding treatment options. For this research, it is important to understand how the proteins of the virus work and what drug
candidates could bind to them. Computer simulations can help with this.However, since proteins are large and complicated, with
many degrees of freedom, their simulations can be very complex and need a large amount of computing timeâ€”or input from the
puzzle-solving intuition of humans. You can help with both if you own a computer: by helping to solve protein-structure puzzles
yourself or by donating some of your computing power.
