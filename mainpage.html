The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed a number of weaknesses in the world is healthcare systems and in 
the global economy. In a new editorial a team of engineers and computer scientists argue that the current pandemic moment ought to 
serve as a wake-up call for society and the public health community to embrace the opportunities of robotics.India can take a cue
from China, which has heavily used technology to fight the deadly coronavirus. For example, China is using drones that allow its
authorities to scan through large crowds. Drones are equipped with thermal imaging and can quickly detect people who have a fever.
Chinese giant, Baidu has developed an AI-powered non-contact infrared sensor system that has been used in places like railway
stations to quickly detect a person suspected of a fever.
